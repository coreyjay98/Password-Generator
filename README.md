# Brief #
In this project I was tasked with creating a random password generator for my client, they requested that I utilise checkboxes and Javascript to give them the choice of picking specific characters.

On the day of submission for this assignment I have not yet managed to fully complete the task at hand, I ultimately could not work out the javascript behind the generator, I managed to get the generator to work but was not able to utilise the checkboxes to allow the client to choose what they wanted in the password. Ast his is an on-going project I will have more time to edit and fix these problems when I become more adept at using Javascript and will have to do more research in my own time to work out the problems I came across. I believe I will have to make changes to the HTML in order to help my script as I think a form would work better than the div I was using. 

This project was a major learning curve for me as I quickly leaned that I had tro put more effort into leaning Javascript as it is a fundamental building block of most internet pages and so is vital to progress as a front end developer. I am willing to put the work in to improve and so this will be a natural steppingstone in my progression in time to come.
