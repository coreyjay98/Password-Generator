# Brief

In this project I was tasked with creating a random password generator for my client, they requested that I utilise checkboxes and Javascript to give them the choice of picking specific character sets and set the length of the password.

## Review

This project initially proved to be a challenge for me as I had little experience of Javascript and so I had to combine learning the language into this project and do both simultaneously. I eventually began to pick up the basis of Javascript and was able to use arrays and concatenations to build a mix of characters depending on what checkbox was ticked and then used that array to pick random characters and create a password. A challenging yet rewarding project for me!

### Features

This site is a single purpose password generator that allows the user to choose which characters they wish to include, they have the choice of Upper Case letters, Numbers and special symbols. This gives some variety and will help to build a secure and random, password for any user.
